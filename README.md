Project Description:

The objective of developing the QR Code Generator and Scanner is to provide a simple, user-friendly web application that can generate and scan QR codes efficiently.
The system allows users to generate QR codes for text, URLs, or any other information that can be encoded into a QR format. Additionally, the scanner feature allows users to upload an image or use their device camera to scan QR codes and retrieve the embedded information.
With QR codes becoming a common tool for sharing information, from business details to Wi-Fi passwords, this project aims to provide a platform where users can effortlessly create and decode QR codes, making it useful for both personal and professional use.
Features:

The QR Code Generator allows users to input text or URLs, which will be converted into a downloadable QR code image.

The QR Code Scanner provides users with two options:
1. Upload an image of a QR code for scanning.
2. *Use a live camera feed to scan a QR code in real-time.

The system will display the decoded information, whether it is a URL, text, or any other encoded data.
The application ensures that the status of the scanner is reset properly after every scan, allowing continuous use without needing to refresh the page.
The interface is designed to be responsive, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
Error handling is implemented to notify users in case of invalid QR code inputs.

Note:
For the project to function, a stable internet connection and access to a device camera (for scanning) is required.

How to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure the API used is updated regularly.
3. Access the application in your browser to generate or scan QR codes.
